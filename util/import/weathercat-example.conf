# Specify our source. Available options are:
#   CSV - import obs from a single CSV format file
#   WU - import obs from a Weather Underground PWS history
#   Cumulus - import obs from a one or more Cumulus monthly log files
#   WeatherCat - import obs from a one or more WeatherCat monthly .cat files
# Format is:
#   source = (CSV | WU | Cumulus | WeatherCat)
source = WeatherCat

[WeatherCat]
    # Parameters used when importing WeatherCat monthly .cat files
    #
    # Directory containing WeatherCat year folders that contain the monthly
    # .cat files to be imported. Format is:
    #   directory = full path without trailing /
    directory = /var/tmp

    # When importing WeatherCat monthly .cat file data the following weeWX
    # database fields will be populated directly by the imported data:
    #   barometer
    #   dateTime
    #   dewpoint
    #   inHumidity
    #   inTemp
    #   outHumidity
    #   outTemp
    #   radiation   (if WeatherCat data available)
    #   rain
    #   rainRate
    #   UV          (if WeatherCat data available)
    #   windDir
    #   windGust
    #   windSpeed
    #   windchill
    #
    # The following weeWX database fields will be populated from other
    # settings/config files:
    #   interval
    #   usUnits
    #
    # The following weeWX fields will be populated directly by the imported
    # data provided the weeWX schema has been modified to accept them.
    #   windrun
    #
    # The following weeWX database fields will be populated with values derived
    # from the imported data provided the --calc-missing command line option is
    # used during import:
    #   altimeter
    #   ET
    #   heatindex
    #   pressure
    #
    # The following weeWX fields will be populated with derived values from the
    # imported data provided the --calc-missing command line option is used
    # during import. These fields will only be saved to the weeWX database if
    # the weeWX schema has been modified to accept them. Note that the pyephem
    # module is required in order to calculate maxSolarRad - refer weeWX Users
    # Guide.
    #   appTemp
    #   cloudbase
    #   humidex
    #   maxSolarRad

    # How will the interval field be determined for the imported records.
    # Available options are:
    #   derive - Derive the interval field from the timestamp of successive
    #            records. This setting is best used when the imported records
    #            are equally spaced in time and there are no missing records.
    #   conf   - Use the interval setting from weewx.conf. This setting is
    #            best used if the records to be imported have been produced by
    #            weeWX using the same archive interval as set in weewx.conf on
    #            this machine.
    #   x      - Use a fixed interval of x minutes for every record. This
    #            setting is best used if the records to be imported are
    #            equally based in time but there are some missing records.
    #            This setting is recommended for WU imports.
    # To import WeatherCat records it is recommended that the interval setting
    # be set to the Sampling Rate setting used by WeatherCat as set on the
    # Misc2 tab under WeatherCat Preferences unless the Adapative Sampling Rate
    # was used in which case interval = derive should be used.
    # Format is:
    #   interval = (derive | conf | x)
    interval = x

    # Should the [StdQC] max/min limits in weewx.conf be applied to the
    # imported data. This may be useful if the source has extreme values that
    # are clearly incorrect for some observations. Available options are:
    #   True  - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are applied.
    #   False - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are not applied.
    # Format is:
    #   qc = (True | False)
    qc = True

    # Should any missing derived observations be calculated from the imported
    # data if possible. Available options are:
    #   True  - Any missing derived observations are calculated.
    #   False - Any missing derived observations are not calculated.
    # Format is:
    #   calc_missing = (True | False)
    calc_missing = True

    # Specify the character used as the decimal point. WeatherCat monthly .cat
    # files may not always use a fullstop character as the decimal point. The
    # character must be enclosed in quotes. Format is:
    #   decimal = '.'
    decimal = '.'

    # Imported records are written to archive in transactions of tranche
    # records at a time. Increase for faster throughput, decrease to reduce
    # memory requirements. Format is:
    #   tranche = x
    # where x is an integer
    tranche = 250
