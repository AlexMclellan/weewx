#TO DO for V3.9

Configuration:
 - Figure out some way to preserve comments when upgrading a skin.conf that has nothing
 left in a section.
 - Extension installer needs to patch old skins on the fly.
 - Installer should now modify `[Defaults]` section to set unit system when doing a fresh install.
   
User's Guide updates:
 - Change references to Standard skin to Seasons.
 - Mention the Mobile and Smartphone skins.
 - Document how new skin defaults work

Upgrade guide
 - Document upgrade process for new skin defaults.
 
Root level `log_success` and `log_failure` are now documented. They should work for reports,
but how about other things, in particular the uploaders?
