To do list for the Seasons skin

Change the old tag formatting scheme to the new scheme using `.format()` exclusively.
 - Seasons
 - Mobile
 - Smartphone

The install script should install Seasons into the skins directory if its not already there.
Same with Mobile and Smartphone. Otherwise, it doesn't touch anything.

Documentation needs to be updated.
 - Change references to Standard skin to Seasons.
 - Mention the Mobile and Smartphone skins.
