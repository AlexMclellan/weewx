To do list for the Seasons skin

The install script should install Seasons into the skins directory if its not already there.
Same with Mobile and Smartphone. Otherwise, it doesn't touch anything.

Config routines need to inject stanzas for Seasons, Mobile, and Smartphone into weewx.conf.

Documentation needs to be updated.
 - Change references to Standard skin to Seasons.
 - Mention the Mobile and Smartphone skins.
